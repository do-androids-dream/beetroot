Task 1

Write a function called oops that explicitly raises an IndexError exception when called.
Then write another function that calls oops inside a try/except stateÂ­ment to catch the error. What happens if you change oops to raise KeyError instead of IndexError?

"""
Task 2

Write a function that takes in two numbers from the user via input(), call the numbers a and b, and then returns the value of squared a divided by b, 
construct a try-except block which raises an exception if the two values given by the input function were not numbers, and if value b was zero (cannot divide by zero).
